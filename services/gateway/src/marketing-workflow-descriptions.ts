/**
 * Marketing Workflow Descriptions — Rich, production-quality descriptions.
 *
 * Overlays the terse boilerplate descriptions in marketing-workflows-data.ts
 * with narrative descriptions that read credibly in the UI's right-panel
 * guide and marketplace cards. Kept as a separate module so the workflow
 * data file stays machine-generated-friendly.
 *
 * To extend: add the workflow's slug or id as key. Descriptions are merged
 * on read via getWorkflowRef() — the overlay wins if both are defined.
